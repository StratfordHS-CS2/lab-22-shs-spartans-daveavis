# Lab 22 - SHS Spartans

This is a variant on a popular coding job intervew question.

Prompt the user to enter a number.  Print out all of the numbers from 0 through the user's number.  However, if the number is a multiple of 3 print "SHS", and if the number is a multiple of 4 print "Spartans".  If the number is multiple of both 3 and 4 (like 12) then print "SHS Spartans".

**Note:**
0 is a multiple of both 3 and 4 since 0 % anything == 0.

**Example:**
```
Enter a number: 13
SHS Spartans
1
2
SHS
Spartans
5
SHS
7
Spartans
9
10
11
